/**
 * A generic product is the idea of something, in the Aristotlean sense
 * (see Theory of Forms).  A generic product might have many formulations,
 * representations, sizes, shapes; but at its core, it's still that one
 * idea of a thing.  For instance, a recling chair is still just a chair.
 * A blue, medium-sized glove is still just a glove.  A surgeon with large
 * hands might complain that the glove is too small, but if it's all we
 * have then she will get over it.
