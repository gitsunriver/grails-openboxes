/**
 * This class is meant to link together two transactions--a Transfer Out and a Transfer In--that
 * represent a transfer of goods between two locally-managed warehouses.  This is for when we want to 
 * create a direct, immediate transfer, as opposed to transferring via a Shipment 
 * 
 * Use the following methods within InventorySevice to create, modify, and delete LocalTransfers:
 *  getLocalTransfer(Tranasction)
 *  isLocalTransfer(Transaction)
 *  isValidForLocalTransfer(Transaction)
 *  deleteLocalTransfer(Transaction)
 *  saveLocalTransfer(Transaction)
 *  
 * These methods make sure the two linked transactions stay in sync. See docs on these methods for more information.
